# Project Plan for Bing Search Automator Website

## Overview

The Bing Search Automator is a web application that allows users to automate searches on Bing using random jokes as search terms. The application leverages an iframe to display search results and interacts with the Official Joke API to fetch jokes.

## Objectives

- To create a user-friendly interface for automating Bing searches.
- To ensure seamless integration with the user's Microsoft account for authentication.
- To provide real-time feedback on the number of searches performed and points accumulated.

## Features

1. **User Interface**

   - A clean and responsive design using React and Tailwind CSS.
   - Two input fields for:
     - Search Count (minimum value: 1)
     - Search Delay (minimum value: 10 seconds)
   - A Start button to initiate the automation process.
   - A display area for accumulated points.

2. **Functionality**

   - Upon clicking the Start button:
     - The application retrieves the user-defined search count and delay.
     - It fetches the specified number of jokes from the Official Joke API.
     - Each joke is used as a search term for Bing.
     - The iframe's source is updated to reflect the Bing search results for each joke.
     - The application waits for the specified delay before proceeding to the next search.
     - Points are accumulated based on the number of searches performed and displayed in real-time.

3. **Background Automation**

   - The automator runs in the background, allowing users to interact with the website while searches are performed.

4. **Re-initialization**
   - Users can click the Start button again to restart the automation process with new parameters.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: No backend required; all operations are client-side.

## Milestones

1. **Design Phase**

   - Create wireframes and UI mockups.
   - Define user experience flow.

2. **Development Phase**

   - Set up the React application.
   - Implement the user interface components.
   - Integrate the Official Joke API.
   - Develop the automation logic for Bing searches.

3. **Testing Phase**

   - Conduct unit testing for individual components.
   - Perform integration testing to ensure all features work together seamlessly.
   - User acceptance testing to gather feedback.

4. **Deployment Phase**
   - Deploy the application to a hosting service.
   - Monitor performance and user feedback for future improvements.

## Conclusion

The Bing Search Automator aims to provide a fun and engaging way for users to interact with Bing search results using humor. By following this project plan, we can ensure a structured approach to development and deliver a high-quality product.
